## Original License
In order that the comments on each source file don't stretch into the 
hundreds, while still maintaining credit and provenance, the original 
BrewPi project license statement follows (taken from the header of each 
file.)  If a file has been modified in any way for the BrewPi Remix 
project, the license comments on the code header have been changed to 
that of the new (derivative) project.
